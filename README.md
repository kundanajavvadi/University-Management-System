In the University Management System project, I used Java for the frontend and MySQL for the backend. For the user interface, I worked with JSwing to design simple and interactive screens. These screens allow users to perform various tasks like adding or updating details, applying for leave, viewing fee structures, checking exam results, and seeing applied leaves for both students and teachers.

To connect the frontend with the backend, I used the JDBC driver, which helps in sending and receiving data between the application and the database. This made it possible to store, retrieve, and manage all the information effectively. The goal was to create a system that is easy to use and meets the needs of both students and staff.
